          ) developing a smartphone app for rapid COVID-19 screening through
          artificial intelligence (AI) / machine learning (ML) technology, today
          announced that it has been awarded a contract from the Biomedical
          Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the
          Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response
          (ASPR), within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),
          a U.S. government agency.

        <p className="text-base mt-4">
          This project aims to research and develop COVID-19 screening through
          AI / ML Technology. Virufy’s patented and patent-pending solution
          gathers a patient’s cough / speech data and then, using AI / ML
          algorithm, rapidly analyzes that data against known COVID-19
          Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive, and Covid-19 PCR-negative
          cough datasets to indicate potential active COVID-19 infection. PCR
          testing is universally acknowledged as the gold-standard in molecular
          diagnostics and COVID-19 testing.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base mt-4">
          This Virufy project aims to empower individuals, clinicians,
          employers, and governments with early, actionable COVID-19
          information, to provide cost-effective, faster results for capturing
          and predicting health events anda reduction in overburdening scarce
          healthcare resources so that timely responses and medical
          interventions can be better deployed.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base mt-4">
          While Virufy has obtained a contract with BARDA, the limited funds are
          contractually restricted to contract deliverables and data collection,
          and we remain a 501(c)(3) entity principally staffed by volunteers and
          pro bono vendors.
        </p>
        <p className="text-base mt-4">
          “We are profoundly appreciative of the hundreds of volunteers and
          dozens of pro-bono firms that have selflessly donated their time,
          creativity, expertise, and compassion in support of our Mission of
          public good, and for BARDA’s / DRIVe’s generous support to fund the
          advancement of Virufy’s Covid-19 screening through AI / ML technology”
          said Virufy CEO, Amil Khanzada. This project has been funded in part
          with Federal funds from HHS/ASPR and BARDA, under Contract No.
