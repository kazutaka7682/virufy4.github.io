      "Question#1": {
        "numberQuestion": "Question #1",
        "questionIdQ": "How was this initiative created?",
        "questionIdA": "When the pandemic hit, Virufy’s founder, Amil, knew smartphones were omnipresent and that COVID impacted the nose, throat, and lungs. He hypothesized that breathing and cough sounds could be analyzed with machine learning to detect COVID patterns. Wanting to make a positive impact, he orchestrated a clinical study with 362 patients in an esteemed university hospital. The original team of Virufy, beginning with Stanford graduate AI students, expanded to volunteers from universities around the world.\n\nAs a <a target='_blank' href='https://www.oneyoungworld.com/'>One Young World Japan</a> ambassador who has travelled to over a dozen countries, Amil understands the global perspective and how a smartphone-based solution can be used by people all over the world."

      "Question#2": {
        "numberQuestion": "Question #2",
        "questionIdQ": "What will your organization do?",
        "questionIdA": "Virufy aims to build the world’s largest dataset of COVID cough sounds by generating a movement where millions of people collectively contribute their data to fight our common enemy, COVID. As a 501(c)(3) non-profit startup free of institutional red tape and with a diverse team across 20 countries, we are well positioned to make this happen.\n\nOnce approved by local public health authorities, smartphone app(s) for rapid, no-cost COVID testing will be released in low-income countries. These apps will allow for mass-scale, anonymous testing to slow the virus spread. We hope to unite people across borders in our effort to stop COVID and create a new paradigm for global collaboration.\n\nWe want to create a future where community spread of infectious diseases is greatly reduced, as the world population is empowered by smartphone apps to detect their illnesses early on."

      "Question#1": {
        "numberQuestion": "Question #1",
        "questionIdQ": "Why are COVID-19 coughs distinguishable?",
        "questionIdA": "Similar to other respiratory diseases, COVID-19 damages the throat and lungs, creating detecable differences in cough patterns. Consequently, cough sounds can be analyzed to detect COVID-19​.​ Globally, this idea is being actively researched by several prestigious institutions, including Carnegie Mellon (CMU), MIT, and Cambridge. For example, research done by University of Cambridge showed that a simple binary machine learning classifier is able to classify COVID-19 positive patients through breathing and coughing sounds with high accuracy. Similarly, researchers at CMU identified 18 voice features that distinguish positive COVID-19 patients and trained an academic model to detect COVID-19 with high accuracy."

        "numberQuestion": "Question #3",
        "questionIdQ": "How can the app help prevent coronavirus infections?",
        "questionIdA": "By empowering everyone to know their risk status for COVID and other diseases, the potential for the spread of unknown viruses will decrease considerably. Early detection will allow for people to self-isolate and take measures to heal from the virus faster. Meanwhile, nurses in developing countries can use the app to check if a patient has COVID, thus reducing the need to use expensive PCR test kits. People can also check themselves anytime they feel they have a COVID symptoms to confirm whether they need to go to the doctor for a check-up or test for COVID."

      "Question#6": {
        "numberQuestion": "Question #6",
        "questionIdQ": "Will the performance of the AI model in different environments remain unaffected?",
        "questionIdA": "Ideally, we would want users to follow the instructions on the app on how to record their cough. However, we can use a technique called data augmentation to make the algorithm work in all types of situations if needed."
      },
      "Question#7": {
        "numberQuestion": "Question #7",
        "questionIdQ": "What was the main difficulty in collecting and processing data? Was there any region where artificial intelligence was less accurate, for example?",
        "questionIdA": "The process is slow and cumbersome when collecting from hospitals, requiring clinical study forms and IRB approvals. With supervision from Stanford medical advisors, we went through this process for two hospitals in South Asia and are currently in discussions with hospitals in South America and Africa.\nFor collecting directly from users, we spent significant efforts with pro bono expert lawyers to ensure compliance with data privacy laws, including LGPD.\nAs described in our <a target='_blank' href='https://virufy.org/paper'>research paper</a>, some of the difficulties we found in processing data included excessive background noises and incorrect cough recordings submitted by users, which required the AI developers to manually clean the audio samples before training AI models."

      "Question#8": {
        "numberQuestion": "Question #8",
        "questionIdQ": "Has the technology been validated yet?",
        "questionIdA": "Yes, various groups across the world have validated that coughs contain detectable patterns signifying the presence of COVID-19. We believe that rollout of the technology is just a matter of time and collaboration. As outlined in our research paper, we have independently shown that the COVID cough signature generalizes across continents and between clinical and crowdsourced datasets.\n\nWe have already done IRB-approved clinical studies in hospitals in two countries and are currently seeking approvals in Africa, Latin America, and South Asia for clinical studies through private hospital executive and top-level governmental connections."

However, as opposed to previous COVID-19 cough research that targeted the US population, Virufy aims to collect data from multiple sites across the globe. As a student-run initiative with volunteers spanning several countries, Virufy is developing a COVID-19 diagnostic model with greater racial and spatial inclusivity through data that includes a range of ethnicities and community-specific phonological differences.",
  "performanceQ": "Will the performance of the AI model in different smartphones remain unaffected?",
  "performanceA": "Ideally, we would want users to follow the instructions in the app that explain how to record their cough. However, we can use a technique called data augmentation to make the algorithm work in all types of scenarios if needed.",
  "privacyCategory": "Data Privacy",
  "dataStorageQ": "How will Virufy securely store my data?",
  "dataStorageA": "We use JotForm and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for research study data collection. JotForm and AWS store the data in a secure application with restricted access and controls. Your data will be stored with JotForm or AWS until it is downloaded by us. We will store the data in a database with restricted access. If you would like more information about how Jotform and AWS store your data, please visit their respective privacy policies at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.jotform.com/privacy/'> https://www.jotform.com/privacy/</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://aws.amazon.com/en/privacy'>https://aws.amazon.com/en/privacy/</a>. If you would like to learn more please refer to the Virufy privacy policy.",
  "privacyThreatsQ": "Is my privacy ever at risk of being exposed when I donate my cough to Virufy?",
  "privacyThreatsA": "Our strong legal and information security teams have developed a DPIA to address potential risks and threats for your privacy. We will store your personal data in a form that permits us to identify you for a maximum of 4 (four) months in a secure database with restricted access. After 4 (four) months, we will strip all information of your personal details (e.g., your name and contact information) and aggregate this with the information of others, so that you cannot reasonably be identified as an individual. For the avoidance of doubt, what we will retain long-term is anonymized biometric and health data, such as cough recordings, for the purpose of future research into viruses and other medical conditions. If you would like to learn more please refer to the Virufy privacy policy.",
  "privacyPolicyQ": "Does Virufy have a privacy policy and cookie policy?",
  "privacyPolicyA": "Virufy takes your privacy seriously and our legal team has prepared a detailed privacy policy and cookie policy to protect the personal information you share with us through use of our website, participation in our cough donation study, contacting us, and volunteer applications.",
  "thirdPartiesQ": "Will my data be shared with third parties?",
  "thirdPartiesA": "If you opt-in to share your contact information (e.g., email and phone number) with us, we will not distribute any of this identifiable information to any third party, even for research purposes, without your explicit consent. However, we may share your anonymized information, such as your cough sounds, with third parties in order to accelerate global research efforts to stop the COVID-19 pandemic and other future spreads of disease. More details can be found in our privacy policy and the data collection study consent form.",
  "validTechnologyQ": "Has the technology been validated yet?",
  "validTechnologyA": "Yes, various groups across the world have validated that coughs contain detectable patterns signifying the presence of COVID-19. We believe that rollout of the technology is just a matter of time and collaboration. More details can be found on our research page. You may also read about our novel findings in our research paper.",
  "financeCategory": "Financial",
  "financialContributionQ": "Do I need to make a financial contribution if I'm donating my cough?",
  "financialContributionA": "No.",
  "appCostQ": "Will users have to pay to use the app?",
  "appCostA": "As a nonprofit organization our intention is to make the app free for everyone, especially in low-income countries. However, we may need to charge a nominal fee to support our operations in case we are not able to raise enough funds.",
  "generalCategory": "General",
  "moreQuestionsQ": "What if I have more questions?",
  "moreQuestionsA": "More details can be found in our full privacy policy, cookie policy and consent form which is embedded in the data collection app. For questions related to the data collection study, please email us at <a href='mailto:study@virufy.org'>study@virufy.org</a>.
